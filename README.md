# technica-site-2021
Technica's main site for 2021!

*NOTE:* This website project uses SCSS so you need to `npm install` to get the dependencies necessary to watch for changes in `.scss` files, which get processed into the `.css` this site uses.

Don't try to edit the `.css` files directly :)

## SCSS

### Installation

```bash
npm install
```
*You only need to run the install command once after cloning the repo onto your local system.*

### Watch SCSS changes

```bash 
npm run web
```

*You need to run this command every time you make a change to the repo.*

## Prettier

### Installation
```bash
npm install --save dev --save-exact prettier
```

*You need to run this command every time you make a change to the repo. You also need to integrate Prettier with your code editor.*

### Watch CSS Format Changes
*After configuring Prettier locally and adjusting the editor integration settings, you will be able to watch the formatting in .css files on save.*
